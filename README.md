# 👋 Hey, I’m Alex Hoskins

I’m a **Software Engineer** who loves building tools that make life easier, more connected, and just a little more fun. With over a decade of experience mentoring, leading, and solving problems—first as a people leader, now as a developer—I bring empathy and clarity to every line of code I write.

Right now, I’m especially focused on:
- 🚀 Launching **[LevelUp: AI Tools for LinkedIn](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/levelup-ai-tools-for-link/ioomjennaofikknjjjbnnofkaloknbel)** – an AI-powered extension that helps job seekers personalize outreach and stand out
- 🎥 Creating real, relatable content on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@healthyandnuts) about fitness, family life, and tech
- 🧑‍💻 Growing my skills in systems design, frontend performance, and user-first engineering
